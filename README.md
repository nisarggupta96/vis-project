### About

The used car market in the United States is thriving, with millions of vehicles sold yearly. This market offers a wide variety of options for buyers, ranging from high-end luxury vehicles to affordable and practical models. The popularity of the used car market can be attributed to several factors, including the high cost of new vehicles, the specific attributes of a car, the availability of financing options, and the increasing reliability of modern vehicles.
However, buyers and sellers must understand the market trends and factors influencing used car prices. With the increasing popularity of online platforms like Craigslist, CarMax, AutoTraders, etc., for buying and selling used cars, there is a need to explore and analyze the available data to make informed decisions. This project aims to investigate the used car dataset from Craigslist to identify trends and factors that affect the price of used cars. By analyzing the data and creating visualizations, we hope to gain insights that can be useful for buyers and sellers in the used car market.
